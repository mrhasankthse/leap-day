# Presentation

After a long (approx. 10+ years) career in Software Architecture and Development finally in 2014 I embarked on exploration of Data Science and Engineering. The _engineering_ part was really easy for me and the _science_ part was really interesting and I still enjoy every day working with it. It all started with my Masters Thesis which later became a successful european project [HOPSWORKS](https://www.logicalclocks.com/hopsworks). Science then I have been working mostly with _Deep Learning_ in _Computer Vision_ and _NLP_, big data engineering problems and real world _ML_ problems. Previously I worked in industrial automation systems, healthcare management systems and financial analytics systems with SOA architecture and SOLID principles.
